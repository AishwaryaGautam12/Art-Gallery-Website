Every organization, whether big or small, has challenges to overcome and managing the information of Order, Arts, Customer, Gallery etc. The "Online Art Gallery" has been developed to override the problems prevailing in the practicing manual system. This software is supported to eliminate and in some cases reduce the hardships faced by the artists and the customers. The purpose of Online Art Gallery is to automate the existing manual system by the help of computerized equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data/information can be stored for a longer period with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. The required software and hardware are easily available and easy to work with.
